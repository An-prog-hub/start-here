# Context

Organisations with a clearly communicated `Mission`
are more likely to achieve their aim. <br />

There is an indisputable correlation
between having a _concise_ and _understandable_ mission
and the _succesful outcome_
of the people
focussed on acheiving it.
In many cases feats which were previously considered "_impossible_"
are achieved in hitherto _unbelievably_ short timelines.

> _**We choose** to **go to** the **Moon**!_<sup>1</sup> <br />
"_We choose to go to the Moon in this decade
and do the other things, **not because** they are **easy**,
**but because** they are **hard**;
because that **goal** will serve to **organize** and **measure**
the **best** of our **energies** and **skills**, because that **challenge**
is one that we are willing to **accept**,
one we are **unwilling** to **postpone**,
and one **we intend to win**, and the others,
too._" <br />
~ [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy)

Less than 7 years later, on 20 July 1969,
Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon.

SpaceX has a similarly clear mission: https://www.spacex.com/about

![spacex-mission-statement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/65367652-8fc16a00-dc2c-11e9-89b8-63d43d401a38.png)

They too have managed feats most experts thought were impossible
including many records for a privately developed liquid-fueled rocket.
Booster landing and
[reusability](https://www.spacex.com/reusability-key-making-human-life-multi-planetary)
is the key to affordable space travel.

Even if you aren't interested in (_or are **against**_) space exploration,
one thing is _undeniable_, they are _executing_ on their mission.
SpaceX's [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com) project
will bring cheap and high speed broadband internet access
to the
[next billion people](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674983786).
This will be _game changing_ to global development
because people with access to information/knowledge/education
can _dramatically_ improve their own lives
without north-western aid (_handouts_).


# History

We have always had a ["_Why_?"](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here#why)
goal (_or several goals depending on who you ask_) for @dwyl.

_Long_ before we started @dwyl we had been working for charities
and non-profit organisations on a variety of missions.

> "_I believe in a future, where the **value** of your work is not determined by the size of your paycheque, but by the amount of **happiness** you **spread** and the amount of **meaning** you give.
I believe in a future where the **point** of education is not to prepare you for another **useless job**,
but for a **life well-lived**. I believe in a future where an **existence without poverty** is **not** a **privilege** but a **right** we **all deserve**._" ~ [Rutger Bregman](https://youtu.be/ydKcaIE6O1k?t=841)

## _However ..._

Even though our **`start-here`** repo has been read and "_starred_" by _many_ people:

![start-here-stars-sept-2019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/65373907-8b706d80-dc7b-11e9-8f6b-d844b9a975c8.png)

(_evidence that there is **some clarity** in our **purpose**_)

We still feel that we are doing a _poor_ job of _communicating_ the **`Mission`**
to the extent that people have _asked_ us to clarify it.<sup>2</sup>

Our objective with defining a _single_ clear **`Mission`** for the organisation is to help _everyone_ in the community/team _understand exactly_ what we are trying to achieve and how much _effort_ and _perseverance_ it will require along the way.

## Unicef

"_advocate for the protection of children's rights,
help meet their basic needs and expand their opportunities
to reach their full potential_". (21) ~ [UNICEF-Mission-Statement.doc](https://www.unicef.org/pathtraining/Documents/Session%201%20Introduction%20to%20Humanitarian%20Action/Participant%20Manual/1.1%20UNICEF%27s%20Mission%20Statement.doc)

No idea why their mission statement is only available as a downloadable Microsoft Word `.doc` ...
Would have thought it would make sense to have a web page.

## charity:water

"_charity:water is a nonprofit organization bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries._" (16) ~ https://my.charitywater.org/about/mission

# What is _@dwyl's_ `Mission`?

> <sup>1</sup> Moon...? 🌔 Don't _worry_, @dwyl is not "pivoting" to become a "space exploration" company!
We have neither the expertise nor the _desire_ to burn our time/effort on _leaving_ Earth when there is still so much to be _done_ for to help people and planet! We aren't _against_ space exploration, in fact we are _delighted_ that it exists! We are _grateful_ for [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System), [Teflon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene) and [Velcro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook-and-loop_fastener) all of which we have the ["space race"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race) to thank for enabling or popularising! Going to the Moon is a _good_ example of a clear mission which is both **_incredibly_ ambitious** and ***inspiring***. **`While`** we feel it's a _good_ thing certain [Billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45919650) are re-investing some of their wealth into space exploration (_e.g: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson_), because they are advancing technology in many fields as a result and _inspiring_ a **`new`** generation of people into science and engineering, we _wish_ more of the "mega rich" would re-invest their hoards of cash into [poverty](https://youtu.be/ydKcaIE6O1k) alleviation _first_ instead of mega [_yachts_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_yachts_by_length) to [overcompensate](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=overcompensating) for their [insecurities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_security).

> Rather than re-open an issue that has a lot of "_baggage_", I'm opening a _fresh_ one. 🌱
